# PIV analysis for Almog project

The project is a laminar channel with a cylinder wake flow

## PIV experiments

First experiment is Feb. 15, 3 different cylinders



## Analysis
1. Insight PIV analysis
2. PIVPy analysis, see Jupyter notebooks and /results

## Second experiment

Second experiment, April 23, 1 cylinder, with hydrofoil, angles


for all the three angle of attack:   

     Plot of the streamwise velocity profile of $V_x(y)$ normalized to $d,V_{PIV}$ (similar to fig.4 in section 1.3.1). I think we need to do it for only half the width, meaning to only the side with the laser. 
     velocity vector field map corresponds to the __ (choose random time) frame. (similar to fig. 5).
    $V_y(x,y_i,t_j)$ at $y_i = 0, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.2$ and $t_j$ corresponds to ??  frame (choose random frame, same as for the velocity field vector).
    V_y(x=5,y=0,t)

**x and y axis should be normalized to the cylinder diameter of 2cm.

* angle 0deg, rotmeter 35, images: 400-649 = run1 
* angle 3deg rotmeter 35, images: 700-949. (what is the background velocity?, avg velocity far from cylinder and foil) = run2 
* angle 5deg rotmeter 35, images: 1000-1249 ((what is the background velocity?, avg velocity far from cylinder and foil) = run3
